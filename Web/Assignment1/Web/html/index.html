          It was a bright and beautiful morning as I woke up and went to the bathroom for a shower to get ready to go off to school.
		  After getting out the shower I got dressed and immediately ran to the kitchen to make breakfast. 
		  I contacted my friend by the name of Kevaughnii and asked him if he was ready. 
		  Kev was one of my friends that drove to school and since he was passing where I lived he would pick me up. 
		  After talking with Kev on the phone he told me he was 10 minutes away. 
		  I got all my things and went outside as I waited for him. He finally arrived and we went off to school.

        <h3> While we were in the car having a conversation and playing music we saw a black bird flew pass the car windshield. 
		We laughed and made jokes such as: "The poor bird girlfriend lefted him and now he wanted to kill himself". 
		We watched the bird as it flew higher in the air turned and came straight into the bumper of the car.
		We were shocked as we were wondering what was happening. We continued the journey to school and forgot about that incident.
		Now we were finally at school and we headed straight to class since we were running a bit late.On my way to class my left eye started jumping at a rapid pace.
		I then remembered when I was younger and that happened for the first time, my grandmother would say:
